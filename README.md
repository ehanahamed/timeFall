When Kung Fu Panda was first released it was hated. Now Po is an icon in Universal Studios. How did this happen? The animation of the first movie was very choppy but by the time of the second movie it greatly improved.

A Tale of 2 Citiez is a song by J. Cole. This song is very nice. I like it. Please help me. According to Kanye, J Cole sucks. Even though I respect Kanye I like J Cole. He is an excellent rapper. He repeatedly says "Hands in the air" with a good beat attached.


Drake is a predator btw



When drake states "Kendrick just opened his mouth someone go hand him a grammy right now" it is a reference to how Kendrick has so many Grammys since he is the goat.
